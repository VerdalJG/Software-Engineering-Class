# Software-Engineering-Class

University class in which we learned how to code with design patterns. 

Project 1 is a minigame in a console window where you shoot spawning enemies left and right. 

Project 3 is a maze game which uses creational patterns: Factory/Abstract factory and Builder patterns to essentially make different level layouts with different 'tiles'. It is not playable but sets the groundwork to make a maze game.

Project 4 demonstrates the structural pattern: Flyweight - which basically reduces the amount of space and time required to load a texture into the world various times.
